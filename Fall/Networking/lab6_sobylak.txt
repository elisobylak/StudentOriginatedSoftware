1. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source)
that is transferring the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu? To answer this question, it’s
probably easiest to select an HTTP message and explore the details of the TCP
packet used to carry this HTTP message, using the “details of the selected packet
header window” (refer to Figure 2 in the “Getting Started with Wireshark” Lab if
you’re uncertain about the Wireshark windows.
	a. The source IP address is 10.20.77.98, which is my computer.
2. What is the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? On what port number is it sending
and receiving TCP segments for this connection?
	a. The IP address of gaia mass seems to be 128.119.245.12
4. The TCP SYN sequence number seems to be 0.
5. The sequence number of the SYN, ACK segment is also sequence 0.
6. The relative sequence number for the HTTP POST request that my computer sent out is 152977
8. All the TCP segments have a length of 0.
