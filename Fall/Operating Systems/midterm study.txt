TROUGHPUT
This is a measure of how much work is being performed. It depends on the average length of a process but is also influenced by scheduling policy.

RESPONSE TIME
This is the time from the submission of a request until the response begins to be received. It is a measure for the user’s perspective. Turnaround time is the machines perspective.You want low response time to maximize the number of I/O you can do. Uniprogramming has a longer mean response time than multiprogramming. This is because everything has to be done sequentially.
