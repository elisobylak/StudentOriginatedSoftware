Nathaniel Berliner, Eli Sobylak======================================================SOS NetworkingEDURange Recon 1 QuestionsOct 29 2015======================================================Please answer the questions at the end of this document.  The purpose of the EDURange exercise is to give you hands-onexperience scanning a network without the consequences of upsetting areal system administrator.  The EDURange infrastructure is hosted in aprivate network space running on Amazon's EC2 cloud.As instructors, we look to assess student learning and knowledge inmany different ways; EDURange gives us a unique way of doing that.This is an ungraded exercise, but it will give us some feedback onyour background, your ability to work as a team, and how much you'veabsorbed some of the topics we've discussed in class and tutorial.In teaching any topic, there is a natural tension between focusing onprocess and focusing on content, and we are looking for a balance thatcan help teach important and lasting concepts rather than specificdetails that can change rapidly.  Specifically, how much do youneed to know about networks and tools in order to become proficient insecurity versus how much experience do you need with analysis and the securitymindset?  Having you answer the questions below will help us betterprepare labs and teaching material so we get this balance right.Please submit the answers to these questions using sos_submit withthe filename "edurange_R1.txt".  In answering these questions, you shouldrely on your own knowledge (treat this as a self-test).  If you do notknow the answer, write "I don't know".  Please do not use othersources of information like the Web or your textbook.  This is not atest, and it is not graded.  Your participation is entirely voluntary,but will help us understand how hard we should make other assessmentinstruments like the midterm and final exam.[Questions During Lab]nmap -p 1-200 -sP 10.0.128.1-255Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-10-29 21:10 UTCNmap scan report for 10.0.128.4Host is up (0.000086s latency).Nmap scan report for 10.0.128.5Host is up (0.0013s latency).Nmap scan report for 10.0.128.6Host is up (0.0013s latency).Nmap scan report for 10.0.128.7Host is up (0.0013s latency).Nmap scan report for 10.0.128.8Host is up (0.0013s latency).Nmap scan report for 10.0.128.9Host is up (0.0012s latency).Nmap done: 255 IP addresses (6 hosts up) scanned in 2.81 seconds10.0.128.4	- 22	SSH	Ubuntu		- 37592	TCP		- 58911 TCP		- 51412 TCP		- 53786 TCP10.0.128.5	- SSH		Ubuntu10.0.128.6 - SSH		Ubuntu10.0.128.7 - SSH		???10.0.128.8 - SSH		Ubuntu10.0.128.9 - SSH		Ubuntu1:nmap with -Pn and -p 1-65000 10.0.128.1-255  Ports 1-65000[Post-Lab]5. Did you attend the EDURange presentation? (answering this   question helps us calibrate our expectations about the rest   of these answers). 	Nope.6. What is the 3-way handshake?	This is the SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK confirmation that HTTP uses to establish a transmission.7. What does the SYN flag do?	It sets the SYN flag to one to let the receiver know where to synchronize to.8. What does /24 mean?  How many IP addresses does that include?	I think that means the mask for the network is 255.255.255.224.9. What is "slash" version of 255.255.248.0?10. Which options for nmap affect the speed of the scan?   	 -p selects a range of ports and makes the scan faster that scanning the whole network.11. Which options for nmap affect the stealth of the scan?12. Which ports does nmap -sT scan?	This is a TCP scan.13. Which ports does nmap -sU scan?	This is a UDP scan, to see who is using UDP14. How can a network administrator make it more difficult to scan a network?	15. List one pro and one con of a "broadcast ping"16. Sometimes, listening to the network can give you an idea of the    existing machines and services. Does this strategy work for the    EDURange Recon 1 exercise? Why or why not?REFLECTION17. Did you know how to use nmap before doing the exercise?	Only a little bit.18. Had you read [none,   some,   most,   all] of the man pages for nmap? (circle one)	none19. How well does the following describe your process in Recon 1:      >>>>explore options for nmap	discover hosts	use nmap to identify services on each host20. How did the exercise help you to understand TCP better?	How to view details about the network.21.  Why would a network administrator want to make it more difficult to scan a network?
