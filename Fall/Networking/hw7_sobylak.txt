Ch4: R7, R16, P3, P4, P7, P10

R7:
Each input port would store a shadow copy of the forwarding table because with this setup forwarding decisions can be made locally without invoking the centralized routing processor on a per-packet basis. This gets rid of centralized processing bottlenecks.

R16:
This would take up %0.6 of the IP datagram which would let the remainder of the message be application data.

P3:
A bare bones VC network would have the columns Incoming Interface, Incoming VC#, Outgoing Interface, Outgoing VC#. These numbers represent an interface between a virtual network which uses sequential numbers for tracking and the incoming and outgoing port numbers.
A datagram has two columns, packet source and packet destination.

P7:
a.
They could not go at the same time if they are heading to different output ports.

b.
If the fabric uses a crossbar then both packets could be worth it.

c.
Similarly, two packets heading to the same destination could also be sent at the same time through the fabric if it is using a crossbar.
