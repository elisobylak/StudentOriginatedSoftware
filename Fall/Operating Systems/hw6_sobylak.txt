Ch 6: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5
6.6, 6.11, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, *6.18

6.1:
Mutual exclusion: This applies to figure 6.1a with the cars because only one car can be using a given section of the road at a given time
Hold and wait:They are all waiting for each other to go first in this situation
No preemption: Once a car starts moving, there’s not much you can do to get it out of the way
Circular wait: If a car has already started moving into the turn lane, or if they all make a turn into their turns they will all be deadlocks.

6.2:
Two key factors of deadlock avoidance that could be applied to the scenario in figure 6.1 are not starting a process if its demands might lead to deadlock, and don’t grant an incremental resource request to a process if this allocation might lead to deadlock. Obviously there are rules on the road so at a four way stop, this situation doesn’t seem to happen, and when it does, someone has to make a decision to go first. 

6.4:
Deadlock occurs inevitably in the fatal region. The existence of a fatal region depends on the logic of the two process. These two processes do not run into that problem. 

6.15:

c= {3,2,9,7}	a= {1,1,3,2}

n = {2,1,6,5}

6.16:
a.	1. 3
	2. 2
	3. 1
	4. 6
	5. 5
	6. 4
