Ch1: R19 
Ch2: R1, R3, R5, R7, R9, R11, R13-R15, P1-P5 

R19: 
	a. The throughput for this network would be 500 kbps
	b. Assuming a speed of 500 kilobytes per second, it would take about 8 seconds to transfer 4 million bytes
	c. The throughput here would be reduced to 100kbps, and to transfer 4 million bytes it would take 40 seconds, or 5 times as slow as a 500kbps network.

R1: 5 applications 
	Email: uses SMTP
	Remote terminal access: uses telnet
	Web: uses HTTP
	File Transfer: uses FTP
	Streaming multimedia: uses HTTP
R3: Like the exercise we did in lab the other day when we set up the web socket server and clients with python and we made a little chat room in class. Those users who set up a script to connect to a port on the network where clients, and our classmate who set up to port as a server was the server in this instance

R5: To do this, a process can identify another host by sending HTTP requests back and forth. Also IP addresses and port numbers help with routing and communication. 

R7: I would imagine that a stock trading application would require no data loss as well as time sensitivity.

R9: SSL is implemented at the application layer.For a developer to implement a SSL to enhance the security of their TCP connection, they will have to set up a SSL web socket which uses similar methods but has its own socket API.

R11: All of there applications use TCP for their transport protocol because TCP provides reliable data transfers. This guarantees that all the data will get their eventually.

R13:Web caching can recur the delay in receiving a request by saving information from previously visited website and reusing data if the information is the same as the last time you visited it.  

R15: FTP is referred to as out-of-band because it uses a separate control connection. In band would be SMTP and HTTP

P1: 
	a. F
	b. T
	c. T
	d. F
	e. F
P2: Command for FTP include USER, PASS, LIST, RETR, and STOR

P3: Besides HTTP, to request a web document you may need FTP and some other protocols as well.

P4: 
	a. gaia.cs.emass.edu
	b. It’s running HTTP v1.1
	c. This would be a persistent connection
	d. Not sure, either 1.7.2 or 200.408.04
	e. They are using Firefox, you need to know this for encoding reasons. 
P5: 
	a. It was successful in finding the document and 
	b. It was at 18:27:46 GMT
	c. it received the message at Sat, 10 DEC2005
	d. The first 5 bytes are “Spring 2005 homepage”. It has agreed to a persistent connection.
