P14: If you were to receive 3 duplicate ACKs for a given segment serves as an implicit NAK. This in turn tigers a retransmission of that segment before timeout.

P20: See figure 3.52

P36:
It may use three duplicates because after only one, it may not be possible to tell whether the receiver or the sender was the one with the error. Basically, three allows a pattern to emerge and as soon as there are three in a row, an error can assumed to have occurred.

P38:
Yes. the rate must be the same.

P40:
a. TCP slow start is between 1 and about 5.
b. Congestion avoidance is taking place between 6 and about 23.
c. Nope, that is normal
d. Nope, that is normal
e. The initial value is 16.
f. The value at transmission round 18 is 24
g. Then at 24, it is 1
h. Not sure
i. It should have a value of 3
