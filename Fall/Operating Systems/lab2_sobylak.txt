Lab 2:

Part I
I have successfully been able to add my project files to Github. In addition, I’ve been able to put a branch of ASST0 on github so I can go back to different version of working code which is nice. 
To make a new Git branch, I’ve been using the procedure;
git checkout -b new_branch_name \\ create and switch to new branch
git add . \\ add updated folders to github
git commit -m "message here"
git push origin new_branch_name

Part II
I was able to locate and change the banner during the boot process so it says my name and the OS’s version number. 

Part III
Most of the commands do not work yet in any of the menus. The ones that do work are some test functions like thread tests which just dump a bunch of numbers to the screen, and is probably doing more that I have not discovered yet.
