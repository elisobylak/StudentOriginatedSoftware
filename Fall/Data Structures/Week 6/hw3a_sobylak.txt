Using any of these methods on a vector may invalidate a iterator looking at the vector because where Iâ€™ve used iterators looking at vectors I had to include a for statement that sets a beginning, end point, and step increase amounts. Normally it looks like this;
list<int>::iterator iter;
	for(iter = list.begin(); iter != list.end(); iter++) {
	/*code*/
}
